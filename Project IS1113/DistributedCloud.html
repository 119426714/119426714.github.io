<P> Distributed Cloud Computing generalizes the cloud computing model to position, process, and serve data and applications from geographically distributed sites to meet requirements for performance, redundancy and regulations. </P>

 <h3> Overview </h3>
<P> The traditional cloud computing model offers on-demand, metered access to computing resources—storage, servers, databases, and applications—to users who do not want to build, buy, or run their own IT infrastructure. Public cloud service providers maintain and run large server farms whose resources are shared between users, with virtualization techniques that provide isolation and security of individual user data. Site redundancy across regions provides for recovery from outages and disasters, with all the monitoring and management aspects of keeping the cloud up and running transparent to cloud users. </P>

<p> While distributed computing spreads computation workload across multiple, interconnected servers, distributed cloud computing generalizes this to the cloud infrastructure itself. A distributed cloud is an execution environment where application components are placed at appropriate geographically-dispersed locations chosen to meet the requirements of the application. </p>

Such requirements include:

Location: to enable more responsive and performant service delivery for certain types of applications, where latency is critical and bulk data transfer to and from a central cloud is expensive.
Regulations: which may require that data never leaves the user’s country, as is the requirement in the EU.
Security: to ensure that certain data and processes remain within an enterprise’s private cloud or data center, with which a public cloud is integrated.
Redundancy: beyond that provided by local, regional, or national site redundancy to mitigate large scale outages that can affect enterprises.
The distributed cloud service provider ensures the end-to-end management for the optimal placement of data, computing processes, and network interconnections based on the above-mentioned requirements. And it appears as a single solution from the cloud user’s point of view.

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is one example of a distributed cloud, where storage (e.g., video content) is positioned in geographically diverse regions to reduce the latency of delivery. Enterprises using CDNs to distribute content get the benefits of scaling both storage and performance.
