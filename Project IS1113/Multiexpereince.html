   <h2> Definition </h2>
<p>Multi-experience development platforms (MXDPs) help enterprises to rapidly scale their applications across a range of devices and platforms. MXDPs can help you develop a single application that can be deployed on a variety of devices. This greatly shortens down your efforts and gives brands more control over their digital experiences.</p>

 <h3> Overview </h3>
<P> Multiexperience is a concept pioneered by Gartner late in 2019. The concept is being championed as one of the biggest developments for 2020. In fact, Gartner states that “more than 25% of the mobile apps, progressive web apps and conversational apps at large enterprises will be built and/or run through a multiexperience development platform” by 2023.

In short, multiexperience is about adapting to the increasing market of different devices and their respective experiences. Applications now need to run on different platforms and adapt easily, all while providing a consistent experience from a business perspective.

Why is this relevant? For one, it’s because a few companies are already doing it and, for another, it’s because the average individual currently owns 3.2 different devices. In other words, it’s becoming the increasingly expected norm.

But, other than a few key examples, little more is known than this. This is where we’re here to help. </P>
