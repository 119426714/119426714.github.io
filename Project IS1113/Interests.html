   <p> <b>Hockey</b>  </p>
     
  
      <p>My love for hockey began when I was 8 years old. </p> 
     <P> The primary school i attended was big into hockey. </p>
      <p> As a girl who loved sports i was determined to be on the first team. </p>
      <p> We trained every week and soon i was on the first team playing midfeild. </p>
      <p> We competed in the Cork Hockey Cup and won. .</p>
      <p> My hockey career continued in secondary school. </p>
      <p>I was on the junior and senior team throughout my time in Scoil Mhuire. </p>
      <p> Training was weekly and it was a great way to make new friends. </p>
      <p> We won the Junior Munster Hockey Cup in 2015. </p>
      <p> Unfortunetly we lost the Senior Munster Hockey Cup to MMC 2019. </p>

      <p> <b> Swimming </b> </p>


      <p>I started swimming when I was 3 years old in Silver Springs Cork. </p> 
     <P> With lessons every week soon I was a confident, strong swimmer. </p>
      <p> My swimming instructor was tough and sometimes too tough. </p>
      <p> I moved to Aqua Leisure in Youghal. </p>
      <p> I continued to swim in the Maradyke.</p>
      <p> I do swimming camps every summerin Ardmore. </p>
      <p>I compete in many competions around Ireland. </p>
      <p> Competions are a great way to make new friends. </p>
